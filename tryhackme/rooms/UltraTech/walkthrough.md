## The root of all evil
Let's now proceed to the ftp service using the obtained credentials.

I was able to access the ftp with the `r00t` credential. 

I tried the `admin` credential in ftp and ssh, but no avail. But it worked in the login page of port `8081/partners.html` and directed to me to an html page with this message:
```
Restricted area

Hey r00t, can you please have a look at the server's configuration?
The intern did it and I don't really trust him.
Thanks!

lp1
```

I remember there is a hidden directory from `/home/lp1` called `.config`. But I think it's not really important.

Let's get the root.

Let's access `r00t` with ftp again.

But it can't run `cat` command. So I tried the `r00t` credential in ssh and it worked.

It's time to do some escalation.

After a number of failed tries of some privilege escalation tactics, I finally found out that we can escalate using the docker.

Finally got the command from [GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/docker/) to access root!

To get the private ssh, head to `/root/.ssh` directory and copy the first nine characters.
